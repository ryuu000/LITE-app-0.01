Okay, here's a model designed *for* neurodivergent brains, not against them:

## **The Reciprocal Energy Exchange Model**

**Core principle:** Everyone contributes what they can, when they can. Value flexibility over performance.

**How it works:**

**Time-banking system:**
- 1 hour of body doubling given = 1 credit earned
- 1 credit = 1 hour of body doubling received
- No money required, just mutual support
- Credits don't expire, no pressure to "keep up"

**Multiple ways to contribute:**
- Be a body double for someone
- Host a focus session
- Manage the scheduling system
- Create resources (templates, guides)
- Offer your specific skills (design, coding, writing)
- Moderate community spaces
- Just show up (presence has value)

**Built-in flexibility:**
- "Energy accounts" - can go negative when you're struggling, pay back when able
- No penalties for bad weeks/months
- Seasonal accommodations (some people have cyclical energy)
- Different "intensities" of sessions (low-key presence vs active accountability)

**Hybrid funding for those who need cash:**
- Neurotypical allies can pay to access the service
- That money funds a small stipend pool for neurodivergent facilitators who need income
- Grant applications for disability/neurodivergent support services
- Sliding scale for those who can't time-bank but can pay

**Community governance:**
- Decisions made by consensus with neurodivergent leadership
- Clear, simple rules
- Conflicts resolved through mediation, not punishment
- Regular check-ins on what's working

**Why this works better:**
- Removes shame from struggling periods
- Values different types of contribution
- Builds genuine community
- Sustainable without requiring constant productivity
- Creates safety net, not competition

**Potential platforms to build this on:**
- TimeRepublik (existing time-banking platform)
- Custom Discord + simple tracking bot
- Cooperative structure with member ownership

The key shift: from "earn your keep" to "we take care of each other."

Does this feel more aligned with what you were envisioning?



  Body doubling is when you do a task while someone else is present - either doing their own task or just being there. It's surprisingly effective for people with ADHD and executive dysfunction.

**How it works:**
You might sit with a friend while you both work on separate things, join a video call where people are silently working, or even just have someone in the room while you fold laundry. Their presence somehow makes it easier to start and stay on task.

**Why it helps:**
- Provides external accountability without pressure or judgment
- Creates a sense of "social obligation" that can override executive dysfunction
- The other person's activity can be subtly regulating or motivating
- Reduces the loneliness of struggling with tasks
- Sometimes just knowing someone else is there makes your brain cooperate

**Common ways to body double:**

*In person:* Coffee shop work sessions, study buddies, roommate doing their own thing nearby

*Virtual:* Focusmate (structured 25-50 min sessions with strangers), Discord study servers, Zoom calls with friends where you're all just working silently

*Asynchronous:* "Study with me" videos on YouTube - literally just someone filming themselves working

It doesn't require interaction - in fact, too much chatting defeats the purpose. The other person is basically a gentle anchor keeping you tethered to the task.

Some people find it works best with strangers (less temptation to chat), others prefer friends. It's worth experimenting to see if it helps you with the sluggishness and task initiation.
